This is my first attempt at creating a to-do list app with basic functions such as:
1.Adding notes
2.Deleting notes
3.Editing notes (still in progress)
It uses JavaScript for the backend and stores data using localStorage.
Please note that the UI is not yet implemented, so expect a basic HTML interface for now.
